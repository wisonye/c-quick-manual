* Null terminated string

C =string= actually just a sequence of characters.

#+BEGIN_SRC c
  char my_name[] = "wisonye";
#+END_SRC


~sizeof(my_name)~ is =8=, as it includes the final =\0= null-terminated character!!!

~strlen(my_name)~ is =7=, as it doesn't count the final =\0= null-terminated character!!!

But you shouldn't use ~sizeof~ on a ~char *~ (pointer, NOT ~char []~), as ou always get back =4= (4bytes on 32bit) or =8= (8bytes on 64bit):

#+BEGIN_SRC c
  char *my_name= "wisonye12345";

  printf("\nsizeof(my_name): %lu", sizeof(my_name));
  printf("\nstrlen(my_name): %lu", strlen(my_name));
#+END_SRC

Output:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  sizeof(my_name): 8
  strlen(my_name): 12
#+END_SRC
